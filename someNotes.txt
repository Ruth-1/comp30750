make a field size /symbols based on the field we want as legend
then create our legend that uses that field

 "transform":[
            {
              "aggregate": [
                {
                  "op": "count",
                  "as": "Manufacturers"
                }
              ],
              "groupby": [
                "t_manu"
              ]
            },
            {
              "filter": "datum.Manufacturers > 3"
            }
          ],
